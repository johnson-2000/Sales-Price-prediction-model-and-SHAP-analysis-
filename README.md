# Sales Price Prediction Model and SHAP Analysis on Python

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning prediction model for predicting the sales price of residential homes sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The dataset used for this analysis contains various features related to the properties, including square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The project utilizes regression algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM to predict the sales prices accurately.

Additionally, the project incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to interpret the model predictions and understand the impact of each feature on the predicted sales price. SHAP analysis helps in explaining the model's decisions and provides insights into the underlying patterns learned by the machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing: The project includes the loading and preprocessing of the dataset, which involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model training and evaluation: Various regression models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM are trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
- Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance and generalization ability.
- SHAP analysis: SHAP values are calculated to explain the model's predictions and visualize the importance of each feature in determining the sales price of residential homes.
- Visualization: Data visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset and interpret the results of the model predictions and SHAP analysis.
